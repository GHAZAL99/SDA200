## Protocol for using SDA200: Use of PDMS device for the generation of a gradient (using dye)
### Section 1: Reducing the evaporation of the liquids inside the device:
1. Take the chip that you would like to use, and cover its devices with glass slides. (To block the inlets and outlets).
2. Tape the glass slides tightly to the PDMS.
3.Place the chip inside a tip box and fill the latter with enough deionized water so that the chip is immersed in water.
4.	Incubate the chip at 37 ̊C overnight. (Don’t leave it for a longer time, as this may get water inside the devices.)
5.	Use the device immediately after taking it out of the water.

**Note: The steps above are recommended to reduce the evaporation of the liquids in the device. If the evaporation is not an issue, you can skip this section.**

##### Method for injecting liquids in PDMS:
* Using both hands, gently insert the **gel loading tip** of the micropipette in the inlet/outlet. Start injecting the liquid **slowly**. If the solution escapes from the inlet/outlet, push the tip of the micropipette a little bit further in the inlet/outlet.

* While removing, **gently** place a kimwipe around the inlet/outlet and **slowly** pull out the micropipette in the same way you injected it in, make sure to remove your thumb from the pump as the tip is moving out of the inlet/outlet. Keep using Kim wipes to remove any liquid present at the inlet or outlet.

__Note: The method above applies to all the steps below.__

### Section 2: Filling the SDA200 device:

1.	Get 3 Eppendorf tubes. Assign each tube to one of the following liquids: Crystal Violet, Novec oil and water. Place around 0.3 mL of each liquid in its corresponding tube.

2.	Use the p20 micropipette, set at 3 µL to inject water in the Inlet of the device. Keep injecting water (you can press beyond the first stop) till the water reaches the first mark following the inlet.
Note: Make sure no air is present at the inlet area.
